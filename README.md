# Flight Price Predictor

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, `main.ipynb`, that trains a Random Forest regressor to predict flight prices using a cleaned dataset (`Clean_Dataset.csv`). The notebook performs preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and simple visualizations. Output images generated by the notebook are saved in the `outputs/` folder.

---

## Files

- `main.ipynb` - Main notebook with the data processing, training and evaluation pipeline.
- `Clean_Dataset.csv` - Cleaned dataset used by the notebook (must be present in the repository root).
- `outputs/` - Folder containing generated visualizations (e.g., `actual_vs_predicted.png`, `Flights_by_number.png`).
- `README.md` - This file.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ recommended
- The notebook imports the following Python packages:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn

Optional (for running the notebook comfortably):
  - jupyter or jupyterlab

Install packages with pip:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

(Or create a virtual environment first: `python -m venv venv; .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1; pip install -r requirements.txt`)

---

## How to run

Open the notebook with Jupyter and run the cells interactively:

```powershell
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
# or
jupyter lab
```

To execute the notebook non-interactively and produce an executed copy:

```powershell
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute main.ipynb --output executed.ipynb
```

Notes about running:
- Ensure `Clean_Dataset.csv` is in the same directory as `main.ipynb`.
- The notebook removes a specific row by index (`29359`) and drops some columns; keep a backup of the dataset if you need to re-run preprocessing differently.

---

## What the notebook does (high level)

1. Load `Clean_Dataset.csv` into a DataFrame.
2. Basic exploratory visualization (count of flights by airline).
3. Drop an anomalous row and drop unused columns (e.g., `Unnamed: 0`, `flight`).
4. One-hot encode categorical columns (`airline`, `source_city`, `destination_city`, departure/arrival times).
5. Convert `class` to binary (Business=1 else 0) and factorize `stops`.
6. Cast the processed DataFrame to integer types.
7. Split into train/test sets and train a `RandomForestRegressor` (50 trees).
8. Compute evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R^2) and plot actual vs predicted prices.

---

## Expected outputs

- Printed metrics in the notebook (Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R^2 score).
- A scatter plot showing Actual vs Predicted prices.
- PNGs saved to `outputs/` (if the notebook includes save figure calls).

---

## Notes & Caveats

- Some preprocessing choices in the notebook are aggressive (casting all features to `int`). Depending on your data, you may want to preserve floats.
- The notebook drops a hard-coded row index (29359). If your dataset has a different indexing or rows, double-check that step before running.
- One-hot encoding can create many columns; consider feature selection or dimensionality reduction for very large datasets.

---

## Suggested next steps

- Turn the notebook into a Python script or small package for easier repeated runs.
- Add cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV) to improve model performance.
- Add model persistence (save trained model with `joblib` or `pickle`) and a small prediction script or API.
